Blackjack Code
This Python script simulates a basic game of Blackjack, a popular card game played in casinos. The game allows a user to play as the player against a computer-controlled dealer.
Features

Card Dealing: The deal_card() function randomly selects a card from a standard deck of 52 cards, where face cards are valued at 10 and aces at 11.


Scoring: The calculate_score() function calculates the score for a given hand of cards, accounting for the value of aces to avoid busts.


Gameplay: The play_game() function orchestrates the entire game. It initializes user and computer hands, manages user input for hitting or passing, and then determines the winner based on the final scores.


Outcome Comparison: The compare() function compares the final scores and determines the winner or declares a push (tie) based on standard Blackjack rules.


Game Loop: The script allows the user to play multiple rounds of Blackjack by prompting for input at the end of each game.

Usage

Run the Code: Execute the Python script (e.g., python blackjack_simulation.py) to start the Blackjack game.


Follow Prompts: The program will guide you through each round, prompting you to input whether you want to hit or stand during your turn.


Outcome Display: After each round, the program will display the final hands and announce the winner or a tie. You can choose to play another round by entering 'y' when prompted.

Dependencies
This code requires the random module for card shuffling and the art module for displaying the game logo. You can copy the art python file in the repository.


Modification and Extension
Feel free to modify and extend the code to include additional features or variations of the game. Possible enhancements could include:
Implementing a betting system with virtual currency.
Adding more sophisticated player strategies.
Creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more immersive experience.
